About me
======
I am now a third-year undergradute in [School of Computer Science](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/mainm.htm) at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/). I am now supervised by associate professor Yinghuan Shi in Reasoning&Learning Group. My research now mainly focuses on domain adaptation, and I am strongly interested in some math knowledge (but maybe just interest).
